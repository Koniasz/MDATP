# T1071.004 - Application Layer Protocol: DNS

Adversaries may communicate using the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. 
Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.
